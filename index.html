                <p>
                  BE attempts to explore the many facets of human existence. It begins with the narration of Animae; someone or something who/that has existed for as long as he/she/it can remember and contemplates the nature of his/her/its existence and then begins a journey of understanding with the words: "I will call myself GOD and I will spend the rest of forever trying to figure out who I am".
